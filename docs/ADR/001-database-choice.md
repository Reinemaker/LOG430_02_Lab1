# ADR 001: Database Technology Choice

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Corner Shop application requires a database solution that can:
- Store product inventory data
- Track sales transactions
- Support basic reporting
- Be easily deployed and maintained
- Scale with growing business needs

## Decision
We will use MongoDB as our primary database technology.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Flexible schema design allows for easy modifications to data models
- Document-based storage aligns well with our object-oriented codebase
- Excellent performance for read/write operations
- Native support for JSON-like documents
- Easy horizontal scaling
- Strong community support and documentation
- Good integration with .NET through MongoDB.Driver

### Negative
- No built-in support for complex transactions (though not required for our use case)
- Requires additional setup for data validation (handled in application code)
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with NoSQL databases

## Alternatives Considered

### SQL Server
- Pros:
  - Strong ACID compliance
  - Familiar to many developers
  - Built-in data validation
- Cons:
  - More rigid schema
  - Higher resource requirements
  - More complex deployment

### SQLite
- Pros:
  - Simple deployment
  - No server required
  - Good for small applications
- Cons:
  - Limited scalability
  - Not suitable for concurrent access
  - Limited reporting capabilities

## Implementation Notes
- Using MongoDB.Driver 3.4.0 for .NET integration
- Implementing data validation in the application layer
- Using Docker for consistent deployment
- Implementing proper error handling for database operations
